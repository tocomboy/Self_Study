<h2> position: static; </h2>
<p>An element with position: static is always positioned according to 
the normal flow of the page:</p>
<div class="static">
This div element has position: static;
</div>


<h2>position: fixed;</h2>
 <p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative 
to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same 
place even if the page is scrolled:</p>
 <div class="fixed">
 This div element has position: fixed;
 </div>

 <h2>position: absolute;</h2>
 <p>An element with position: absolute; is 
positioned relative to the nearest 
positioned ancestor (instead of positioned 
relative to the viewport, like fixed):</p>
 <div class="relative">This div element has 
position: relative;
 <div class="absolute">This div element has 
position: absolute;</div>
 </div>


 <p>Try to <b>scroll</b> inside this frame to 
    understand how sticky positioning works.</p>
     <div class="sticky">I am sticky!</div>
     <div style="padding-bottom:2000px">
     <p>In this example, the sticky element 
    sticks to the top of the page (top: 0), when 
    you reach its scroll position.</p>
     <p>Scroll back up to remove the 
    stickyness.</p>
     </div>
